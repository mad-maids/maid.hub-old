Website was created in Next.JS and Tailwind CSS. As everybody knows that Next.JS
includes famous frameworks as React and submodules of react. Nowadays, popular
companies like twitch, nike or even tik tok are originating their website with
Next.JS. In addition, they are not facing with any optimisation or request
issue, and I think it's a big plus for Vercel's (creators of Next.JS) team.
