In the first release, I crafted website from zero to bootstrap, which was
actually kinda template website. I actually tried and tested lots of layouts,
grids and flexboxes in order to see what kind of structure does suit for my
website best. I actually redesigned whole website to black & white design. To be
honest, I love **black** color. I wanted to make my website's style as much as I
want, because this website is my personal website where my visitors will have
their impression about my coding and designing style.

# Posts

I added a new webpage called posts. This page renders all posts saved on
`/posts` path and shows **markdown + json** file on meta view. At the beginning,
I thought that it would be better to make my website database connected.
However, due to some connectivity circumstances, I decided to make database
localy hosted and stored all data things to public files.

# About

This webpage is designed to be an introductory page of myself. I tried to make
it responsive and well-designed as possible as. However, this page is still not
finished and will be updated in future releases. At the moment, there exists a
few easter eggs on `/about` page.

# Hotfixes

There were some design ui bugs as 3D polyfill glitches, etc. A few of them were
fixed on V2, but the rest of them still remains unfixed.
