So, lots of things happened on 2020 and 2021. E.g, I met new students which are
20 at the time being, created new communities, dated 2 girlfriends, etc... What
I wanna say is that, I changed my mind, and came into a final decision.

# The Plan

- [x] Finish the second semester of WIUT:BIS
- [ ] Ditch WIUT
- [ ] Transfer to an IT University at Japan
